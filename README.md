# svgcanvas

Mock &lt;canvas> element using &lt;svg> (based on gliffy's canvas2svg).

## Difference from canvas2svg

- canvas2svg mocks only context API while this library also mocks <canvas> element

    You can set canvas.width, canvas.height and canvas.style and this will be synced to the svg element.

## Status

Working on it.
